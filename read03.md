  # Introducing Git #
  Git is **an Open Source Distributed Version Control System.** 
  - **Control System** : means that it is a tracker, it is a place to store content on.
  - **Version Controle System** : this means that it keeps all the history of changes happened
  - **Distributed Version Control System**: means that every developer can have the same code in his computer.
  
  #### Git is important in many ways ####
  1. it helps developers who work in the same project avoid the conflicts
  1. it allows developers to go back in code history and make changes
  1. helps in different brojects that have the same codebase
