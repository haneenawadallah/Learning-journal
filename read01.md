#MarkDown#
Using Markdown Language which is an easy language that can only be used in github pages, you can build a whole website without the using of _HTML_.
##Markdown## language enabels you to create elegant projects with no servers.
For example, if you want to do a header you use a (#) sighn instead of h1 
 you also dont need to add a tag to put an URL code, you can only copy and paste the url and it will be a clickable link. For example, http : //google.com, you also can style you text using many other stylings ~~like this~~
 
You like Emojis? :woman: you can also use them in your broject, you can check their emoji cheatsheet and you will find all of the fun shapes and emotions to share with others or yourself. :heart:
Making lists cant be easier, you put - or * before the items for unordered list, and you are good to go. For example, 
- Apples
- Strawberries
- Bananas
for the ordered lists you will add the numbers like you are on a word sheet
1- one
2- two
3- three
