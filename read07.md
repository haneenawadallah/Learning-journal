# scripts #
- A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.
You could compare scripts to any of recipes, handbooks, manuals, 

- each indivisual task can be devided into a sequance of steps, which will rpresent as lines of codes

- Computers solve problems programmatically; they
follow series of instructions, one after another. The
type of instructions they need are often different to
the type of instructions you might give to another
human.

- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

# Expressions and operators #

- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE  'var color = 'pink';'

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE 'VALUE var area = 4 * 5; '

- Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 
1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 'color = 'pink';'
1. COMPARISON OPERATORS  'buy = 7 > 8; '
1. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS 'area = 5 * 2; '
1. LOGICAL OPERATORS 'buy= (6 > 3) && (2 < 5);'
1. STRING OPERATORS  'greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Haneen'; '




# Functions #
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
## DECLARING A FUNCTION ##
- to create a function, you give it a name and write the statements needed to acheive its task . this is function declaration.
![function](https://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/javascript/images/chapter_4/basic_function.gif "title")
## CALLING A FUNCTION ##
- executing all of the statements in curly braces with one line of code.
'say Hello().'
## GETTING A SINGLE VALUE OUT OF A FUNCTION ##
'function calculateArea(width, height) {
var area = width * height;
return area;
}
var wallOne = calculate Area(3, 5);
var wallTwo = calculate Area(8, 5);'
