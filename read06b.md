# what makes a computerm a computer? #

## every computer have 4 things in common which are:##
1. take input
1. store information 
1. process it
1. output the results

# how information is represented with electricity #
- inside a compuer there are electric wirec and circuits that carry al of the information in the computer
- there are only two options, on &off (Bit) which is the samllest peace of information a computer can store, more wires, more bits.




# how computer use circuits #
- compines all zeros and ones using electrec circuits to get to the output
- the cercuits take an electronical signal (on or off) and it flips it. it you give the circuit a one, it gives you a zero, and if you give it a zero, it gives you a one (this circuit named "not")


# the 4 parts of a computer #

- input , takes information from the outside environment and compine it to binary information
- memory, to store this information
- cpu, calculate information
- output, converts information to physical output

# how software controls hardware # 
- the cpu is the masterchip that controls every othe part of the computer
- binary codes are the most basic form of software and it controls evey part of the hardware
- using python or ruby takes the codes and turn it into milions of binary (01) so the cpu can understand
