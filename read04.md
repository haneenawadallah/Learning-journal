# HTML & CSS
## If you are interested in building websites, There are some points that you need to know:
- HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website.
  - CSS, helps to style this content so it appears to the user the way it was intended to be seen. 
 - These languages are kept separate to ensure websites are built correctly before they're reformatted. 
 - you can think of them as if HTML is the wall, CSS is the paint.
 - CSS is a list of rules that can assign different properties to HTML tags, either specified to single tags, multiple tags, an entire document, or multiple documents.
 - in html, Once a tag has been opened, all of the content that follows is assumed to be part of that tag until you "close" the tag.
 - Using HTML, you can add headings, format paragraphs, control line breaks, make lists, emphasize text, create special characters, insert images, create links, build tables, control some styling, and much more.
