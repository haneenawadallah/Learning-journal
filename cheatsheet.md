# Basic text editors usage commands #

- pwd - (path working directory) shows you in what directory you are
- ls - (list files in current pwd) this one is probably the most useful one. There are many ways to customize it (with flags), the most common for me might be ls -lha which means, list all the files (including the hidden ones) in a column and add info about them (size, etc in human readable form).
- cat - displays/outputs the contents of the file. It is useful for reading a file very quickly, but if the file is long you might want to do head or tail which only displays the first or last lines of the file.
- man - (manual) do man and some command to get the manual for that command. Very useful to know the specific flags for certain commands.
- cd - change directory. You can also do cd ... to move one up or cd ../.. to move two up (etc).
- clear - clears the terminal screen.
- cd - - goest to last path.
- ~ - goes to home directory.
- df -h - displays free disk space.
- du -sh - displays disk usage (the flag s is for summarized form).
- du -sh * - displays the disk usage for every folder or file in that location.
- Another option is to do du -s * | sort -n which will sort the results based on the size from smallest to largest.
- arrow up or arrow down, brings up the last commands. Space bar to go to next page.
- Commands to manage files and folders
- mkdir - makes a directory.
- touch - creates a blank file.
- echo - prints line (ie. echo "hello world!").
- > - appends a line to a file (ie. echo "hello world!" > text.txt). Careful, this command overwrites what's in the file.
- >> - appends to the end of the file (safer).
- history | less - history and "pipe", less is a paginator. To get out of this just press q.
- cp - copy. Careful, it overwrites.
- cp -i - copy with warning. -i means "ask for confirmation".
- mv - move Careful, it overwrites.
- rm - remove Careful, it destroys. (ie. rm -ri to remove recursive and with warning, for example if you want to remove a directory and its contents.)
- -i - ask for confirmation.
. - the dot means here, for example when you are copying something to your current location.
- locate - finds a file.
- srm -rmzv - secure removes files or folders with m medium grade (7 pass DoD compliant), z zero data. If you want to avoid the confirmations add the flag f (force).
- You can join multiple files with cat. For example: cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > file4.txt.
- zip -r foo.zip foo - zips foo into the foo.zip file.
- unzip \*.zip - unzips multiple files.
